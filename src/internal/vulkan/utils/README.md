# Vulkan Utility Functions

This directory contains utility functions for working with Vulkan API.

## Naming Conventions

**Info Structures**: `MossVk__XXX` (e.g., `MossVk__CreateBufferInfo`, `MossVk__AllocateBufferMemoryInfo`)

**Functions**: `moss_vk__xxx` (e.g., `moss_vk__create_buffer`, `moss_vk__allocate_buffer_memory`)

Both structures and functions use double underscores (`__`) to distinguish them as internal Vulkan utility functions.
